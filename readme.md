# Introduction
The demo project is initialized from [https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter10](https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter10). Additions are:
- Code cleanup, bug fix, and better comments.
- Java 9+ support.
- Spring Boot 2.0 migration.
- Easier local debugging by switching off service discovery and remote config file lookup.
- Switch from Postgres to MySQL, and from Kafka to RabbitMQ.
- Switch from Netflix [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix) to [Resilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j).
- Provide [spring-cloud-gateway](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/) API gateway, and substitute deprecated Netflix [Zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul).
- Kubernetes support.
- OpenAPI/Swagger integration via [Springdoc](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi).
- Spring Boot Admin integration.
- Prometheus & Grafana integration.

The project includes:
- [eureka-server](eureka-server): Service for service discovery. Registered services are shown on its web frontend, running at 8761 port.
- [config-server](config-server): Service for config file management. Config files can be accessed via: `http://${config-server}:8888/${appname}/${profile}`. Where `${appname}` is `spring.application.name` and `${profile}` is something like `dev`, `prd` or `default`.
- [zipkin-server](zipkin-server): Service to aggregate distributed tracing data, working with [spring-cloud-sleuth](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/). It runs at 9411 port. All cross service requests, message bus delivery are traced by default.
- [gateway-server](gateway-server): Gateway service to route requests based on [spring-cloud-gateway](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/), running at 5555 port.
- [authentication-service](authentication-service): OAuth2 enabled authentication service running at 8901. Redis is used for token cache. JWT support is also included. Spring Cloud Security 2.0 saves a lot when building this kind of services. 
- [organization-service](organization-service): Application service holding organization information, running at 8085. It also acts as an OAuth2 client to `authentication-service` for authorization.
- [license-service](license-service): Application service holding license information, running at 8080. It also acts as an OAuth2 client to `authentication-service` for authorization.
- [config](config): Config files hosted to be accessed by `config-server`.
- [docker](docker): Docker compose support.
- [kubernetes](kubernetes): Kubernetes support.

**NOTE**: The new OAuth2 support in Spring is actively being developed. All functions are merging into core Spring Security 5. As a result, current implementation is suppose to change. See:

# Tested Dependencies
- Java 8+
- Docker 1.13+
- Kubernetes 1.11+

# Building Docker Images
```
export BUILD_NAME=2.0.0
mvn clean package docker:build
```
In case of running out of disk space, clean up unused images and volumes with:
```
docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)
docker volume prune
```

# Running Docker Compose
```
export BUILD_NAME=2.0.0
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```
Or with separate services:
```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up authentication-service organization-service license-service
```

# Running Kubernetes
NOTE: Kubernetes does not support environment variable substitution by default.
```
kubectl create -f kubernetes/kubernetes.yml
```

# Running Locally
Minimum deployment includes: authentication-service, organization-service & license-service. Just launch them in your favorite IDE.

# Use Cases
Suppose you are using the kubernetes deployment.

### Get OAuth2 token
`curl` is used here, and 31004 is the cluster-wide port of the gateway server:
```
# curl -u eagleeye:thisissecret http://172.16.87.12:31004/api/auth/oauth/token -X POST -d "grant_type=password&scope=webclient&username=user&password=password1"
{"access_token":"d3b817dc-fb7a-4e65-a080-d0e34c0dc4d5","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"a5d12d05-78ff-4170-ab4f-b9c4e9886358","expires_in":41496,"scope":"webclient"}
```
### Get organization info
Use the token returned from previous request.
```
# curl -H "Authorization: Bearer d3b817dc-fb7a-4e65-a080-d0e34c0dc4d5" http://172.16.87.12:31004/api/organization/v1/organizations/e254f8c-c442-4ebe-a82a-e2fc1d1ff78a
{"id":"e254f8c-c442-4ebe-a82a-e2fc1d1ff78a","name":"customer-crm-co","contactName":"Mark Balster","contactEmail":"mark.balster@custcrmco.com","contactPhone":"823-555-1212"}
```
### Get license info associated with organization info
Use the token returned from previous request.
```
# curl -H "Authorization: Bearer d3b817dc-fb7a-4e65-a080-d0e34c0dc4d5" http://172.16.87.12:31004/api/license/v1/organizations/e254f8c-c442-4ebe-a82a-e2fc1d1ff78a/licenses/f3831f8c-c338-4ebe-a82a-e2fc1d1ff78a
{"id":"f3831f8c-c338-4ebe-a82a-e2fc1d1ff78a","organizationId":"e254f8c-c442-4ebe-a82a-e2fc1d1ff78a","organizationName":"customer-crm-co","contactName":"Mark Balster","contactPhone":"823-555-1212","contactEmail":"mark.balster@custcrmco.com","productName":"CustomerPro","licenseType":"user","licenseMax":100,"licenseAllocated":5,"comment":null}
```

### Distributed Tracing via Zipkin
Every response contains a correlation ID to help diagnose possible failures among service call. Run with `curl -v` to get it:
```
# curl -v ...
...
< sc-correlation-id: 3265b50156556c05
...
```
Search it in Zipkin to get all trace info, including latencies if you are interested in.

![zipkin-2](images/zipkin-2.png)

The license service caches organization info in Redis, prefixed with `organizations:`. So you may want to clear them to get a complete tracing of cross service invoke.
```
redis-cli -h 172.16.87.12 -c del $(redis-cli -h 172.16.87.12 -c keys organizations* | gawk '{ print $1 }')
```

### Working with OAuth2
All OAuth2 tokens are cached in Redis, prefixed with `oauth2:`. There is also JWT token support. Comment/Uncomment `@Configuration` in `AuthorizationServerConfiguration` and `JwtAuthorizationServerConfiguration` classes to switch it on/off.

### OpenAPI/Swagger Integration
The organization service and license service have OpenAPI/Swagger integration. Access via `/swagger-ui.html`.

### Spring Boot Admin Integration
Spring Boot Admin is integrated into the eureka server. Access via: `http://${eureka-server}:8761/admin`.

### Prometheus & Grafana Integration
Spring Boot 2.0 added support for using [Micrometer](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer) as the metrics collection facility. Prometheus is chosen to be the metrics registry, running at 9090 port. And Grafana is used to do query and visualization, running at 3000 port.

Grafana dashboards imported here are [4701](https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701) & [5373](https://grafana.com/dashboards/5373):
